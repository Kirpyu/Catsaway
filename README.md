### Description:
Short game made by a group of friends for the GMTK 2024 Game Jam with a unique twist on the tower defense genre. The player starts off with a single tile, which they would gradually turn into an unstoppable island of their will.
<br>
Quickly expand your tiles using gold from defeated enemies and upgrade your contraptions in order to reach the end game.
